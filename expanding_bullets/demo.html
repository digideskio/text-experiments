                <div class="article-body">
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            The "doc fix" is a term for the annual prevention of scheduled cuts in Medicare fees to doctors.
                            <ul class="sub">
                                <li>
                                    A law was passed in the 1990s that sought to restrain costs by tying doctors' pay to a formula--a formal that most agree makes little sense.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    Since then, doc fixes have been used as short-term solutions, keeping doctors' payments stable and occasionally giving them a small raise.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This "permanent doc fix" would allow for regular doctor fee increases.
                            <ul class="sub">
                                <li>
                                    Some wealthier Medicare beneficiaries would pay more, and some of the cost would be added to the deficit.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    This permanent doc fix would also extend a children's health program and some other health initiatives.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            This is a major moment for Mr Boehner.
                            <ul class="sub">
                                <li>
                                    He is being praised by Republicans and Democrats, both inside and outside of Congress, for stepping up to strike a bargain with Democrats rather than trying to satisfy more conservative Republicans who have not been eager to compromise.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    This could be a template for future legislative deals if this one is successful without undermining Mr. Boehner among his rank and file.
                                </li>
                                <li>
                                    He is already taking some hits from his right.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Both Democrats and Republicans would like to run up the vote count as high as possible to put more pressure on the Senate.
                            <ul class="sub">
                                <li>
                                    The deal has encountered resistance from Democrats trying to squeeze more out of the deal.
                                </li>
                            </ul>
