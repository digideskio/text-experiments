                        <h1>Senator Ted Cruz</h1>

                    He has established a national following in less than two years in the Senate thanks to his confrontational approach toward the party establishment and high media profile. An agile debater, Mr. Cruz, 43, will have a robust network of small-dollar donors but will have to persuade his party's establishment wing that he can win the White House. Widely expected to enter the race, he has bulked up his political staff and made repeated visits to early primary states. Mr. Cruz's support would come from his party's hard-liners, including both Tea Party activists and Christian conservatives.

                        <h1>Senator Marco Rubio</h1>

                    <p>
                        Mr. Rubio, 43, came to prominence propelled by Tea Party activists and since then has veered more toward party regulars. As such, he will position himself as the candidate who can bridge the party's conservative and establishment wings. But in doing so, he will have to convince donors and other party figures that he has the gravitas to be president while fending off attacks from the right over his key role in an immigration policy overhaul. Another wrinkle in Mr. Rubio's calculation: He is also up for re-election in 2016 and will have to eventually decide which office to seek.

                        <h1>Senator Rand Paul</h1>

                    <p>
                        No Republican may have as sturdy a floor of support as Mr. Paul. But the central question regarding his candidacy is how big a coalition he can build beyond the libertarian-leaning supporters and army of small-dollar donors of his father, former Rep. Ron Paul, for his presidential bids. His challenge will be to convince traditional Republicans that he is mainstream enough to be the party's standard bearer. But Mr. Paul, 51, has another complication, one that he shares with Mr. Cruz and Mr. Rubio: Will Republicans nominate a junior senator in the wake of Mr. Obama's presidency?

                    Possibly the strongest non-incumbent candidate to enter a primary in more than half a century, Mrs. Clinton, 67, is highly popular among Democrats and bears the promise of making history as the first woman to be president. Her calculation about whether to run will be made less on whether she thinks she can win the nomination and more by whether, after one failed White House run and decades in the political fray, she wants to once again enter public life. But politics and government have long been animating forces in the lives of Mrs. Clinton and former President Bill Clinton.

In a 2013 paper, Benjamin I. Page and Jason Seawright of Northwestern University and Larry M. Bartels of Vanderbilt University surveyed more than 80 wealthy Chicago-area residents and found that 62 percent felt &ldquo;differences in income in America are too large&rdquo; &mdash; a figure generally in line with public opinion.</p>

Only 13 percent of wealthy interview subjects said the government should &ldquo;reduce the differences in income between people with high incomes and those with low incomes.&rdquo; Only 17 percent said the government should &ldquo;redistribute wealth by heavy taxes on the rich.&rdquo; Clearly, <a class="bio">Warren Buffett&rsquo;s</a> <a class="primary">belief that the tax code favors the wealthy</a> over average workers makes him an outlier within his class.</p>

                    Warren Edward Buffett (born August 30, 1930) is an American business magnate, investor and philanthropist. He was the most successful investor of the 20th century. Buffett is the chairman, CEO and largest shareholder of Berkshire Hathaway, and consistently ranked among the world's wealthiest people. He was ranked as the world's wealthiest person in 2008 and as the third wealthiest in 2011. In 2012 Time named Buffett one of the world's most influential people.<br />

                     &ldquo;The average income [of the 400 highest earners in the U.S.] in 2009 was $202 million &mdash; which works out to a 'wage' of $97,000 per hour, based on a 40-hour workweek. (I'm assuming they're paid during lunch hours.) Yet more than a quarter of these ultrawealthy paid less than 15 percent of their take in combined federal income and payroll taxes. Half of this crew paid less than 20 percent. And &mdash; brace yourself &mdash; a few actually paid nothing.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="p9" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="467" data-total-count="3228" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-5">The views of the rich on other policies that might reduce inequality followed a similar pattern. A mere 19 percent of the wealthy, versus two-thirds of the general public, said the government should &ldquo;see to it&rdquo; that anyone who wants a job can find one. Forty percent of the wealthy, versus 78 percent of the public, said the government should make the minimum wage &ldquo;high enough so that no family with a full-time worker falls below the official poverty line.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="p10" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="495" data-total-count="3723" itemprop="articleBody" id="story-continues-6">More recently, one of Professor Page&rsquo;s prot&eacute;g&eacute;s, a Northwestern graduate student named Fiona Chin, has further investigated the subject, conducting interviews with nearly 100 other wealthy Americans across the country. Unlike Professors Page, Seawright and Bartels, whose interviewers typically spent under an hour soliciting their subjects&rsquo; views on a range of policy questions, Ms. Chin limited her discussions to inequality and often spoke with her subjects for several hours at a time.</p>

<p id="p11" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="218" data-total-count="3941" itemprop="articleBody">Ms. Chin&rsquo;s findings, which she is scheduled to present at a conference in April, are even more stark. As she puts it, the rich tend to see inequality &ldquo;as a story about individual hard work, effort and character.&rdquo;</p>

<p id="p12" class="story-body-text story-content" data-para-count="456" data-total-count="4397" itemprop="articleBody">They recognize that growing up poor puts workers at a disadvantage but argue that a middle-class background presents no barrier to economic success and that growing up wealthy can even be a liability because it robs people of their incentive to work hard. In general, Ms. Chin has found, the rich regard those who do not succeed in life as <a class="analysis">&ldquo;people who didn&rsquo;t take advantage of the education system,&rdquo;</a> not victims of circumstances beyond their control.</p>

                    The Estate Tax is a tax on your right to transfer property at your death. It consists of an accounting of everything you own or have certain interests in at the date of death. Most relatively simple estates (cash, publicly traded securities, small amounts of other easily valued assets, and no special deductions or elections, or jointly held property) do not require the filing of an estate tax return. A filing is required for estates with combined gross assets and prior taxable gifts exceeding $5,430,000 in 2015.<br />&nbsp;<br />

                    Mr. Bush is the closest thing the Republicans have to a Hillary Clinton, but there are doubts among Republicans that he will actually run. He said his decision would rest largely on its impact on his family, but Mr. Bush, 61, who has not been on a ballot since 2002, also may not want to enter a primary campaign that he could lose. His support for an immigration overhaul and Common Core education standards are at odds with the party's more conservative wing. But the question of whether Republicans want to nominate a third Bush for the presidency also looms.

                    <p>
                    SNAP benefits cost $74.1 billion in fiscal year 2014 and supplied roughly 46.5 million Americans with an average of $125.35 for each person per month in food assistance. It is the largest nutrition program of the fifteen administered by FNS and is a critical component of the federal social safety net for low-income Americans.

                     &ldquo;Senator Marco Rubio and Senator Mike Lee have come out with a plan that seeks to resolve this debate by giving both sides what they want: Big new tax cuts for families, like a tax credit of $2,500 per child, as well as big tax cuts for owners of capital, including a tax rate of zero on dividends and capital gains.

'It’s sort of the Oprah Winfrey theory of tax cuts,' says James Pethokoukis, an economic policy scholar at the right-of-center American Enterprise Institute. "She was like 'You get a car, you get a car'. Well this is 'You get a tax cut, you get a tax cut.' &rdquo;</p>
