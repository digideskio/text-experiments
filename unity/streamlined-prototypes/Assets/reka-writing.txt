I felt compelled to start writing--it felt as though the divine was trying to speak through me. I was giving the world its messages about how the divine loves everyone, and everything is going to be good again. I felt like I could change the world.

As I wrote, I could see certain letters of my writing coming towards me, flying towards my face. It seemed like a sign that I needed to give special emphasis to these words, to that particular subject.



throughf irst had insight
knew that she was high
knew that what she was going through could be psychotic or crazy or called crazy
but enjoyed it so much
felt so real
chose to believe in it
part saying "hold on, maybe not right"
ignored and went with joy of it
and did eventually lose touch with that adn believe things were true
