7 PROTOTYPES IN ONE
===================

### Overview

This is the original set of prototypes for the TSD story, made in Unity. Please excuse the messiness of the code! Dangers of rapid prototyping :)


### Running 'Em

You can run this in one of two ways:

* Long way: download [Unity](http://unity3d.com/) (several gigs, fyi), then go to File > Open Project > Open Other. Hit the Play icon at the top middle of the screen to play.
* Short way: go to the Prototypes file and open the HTML file. You may be prompted to download the Unity plugin.

Here's how each one works:
